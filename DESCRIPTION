Description: Basic4Cseq is an R/Bioconductor package for basic
        filtering, analysis and subsequent visualization of 4C-seq
        data. Virtual fragment libraries can be created for any
        BSGenome package, and filter functions for both reads and
        fragments and basic quality controls are included. Fragment
        data in the vicinity of the experiment's viewpoint can be
        visualized as a coverage plot based on a running median
        approach and a multi-scale contact profile.
